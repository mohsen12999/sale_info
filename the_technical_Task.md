# the technical Task

Please read through everything and follow the steps. We cannot help you technically as itâ€™s required to solely finish the task without external help to make it equally fair for every participant.

## BACKEND ENGINEERING TASK

ESTIMATED TIME: 480 MINUTES (you are allowed to take more time, but please plan a full working day)

Your task is to generate an invoice and daily sales Report System

Required Skills: NestJS, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Cron Jobs, RESTful APIs, Email Sending, Testing (Unit and Integration)

## Scenario

Your task is to build a system where users can create invoices for sales transactions. The system will automatically generate a daily sales summary report and send it via email at 12:00 PM each day. The report will be sent through a RabbitMQ queue, where a separate consumer service will process the email sending.

## Task Breakdown

1. Invoice Creation Service:

### Project Setup:

Initialize a NestJS project.

Integrate MongoDB for data persistence.

### MongoDB Schema Design:

Design the Invoice model based on the fields provided:

- customer (string): The name or identifier of the customer.
- amount (number): The total amount of the invoice.
- reference (string): A reference code for the invoice.
- date (date): The date the invoice was created.
- items (array of objects): Each item includes:
  - sku (string): Stock Keeping Unit, unique identifier for the item.
  - qt (number): Quantity of the item.

## REST API Development:

Develop the following REST endpoints:

- POST `/invoices` - Create a new invoice.
- GET `/invoices/:id` - Retrieve a specific invoice by ID.
- GET `/invoices` - Retrieve a list of all invoices (with optional filters like date range).

## Testing:

- Write unit tests for the invoice creation and retrieval logic.
- Write integration tests for the REST API endpoints using supertest.


2. Daily Sales Summary Report:

Cron Job Setup:

- Implement a cron job in the Invoice Service to run daily at 12:00 PM.

The cron job should:

- Calculate the total sales for the day.
- Calculate the total quantity sold per item (grouped by SKU).
- Prepare a summary report.

RabbitMQ Integration:

- Publish the daily sales summary report to a RabbitMQ queue named daily_sales_report.

The message should include:

- Total sales amount.
- Per item sales summary (SKU, total quantity sold).

Consumer Service for Email Sending:

- Create a separate NestJS service (email-sender) to consume messages from the daily_sales_report queue.

Implement the consumer to:

- Receive the sales summary report.
- Send an email containing the report (you can mock the email sending or use a service like SendGrid).

Write unit tests for the message processing and email sending logic.




Technical Requirements

Invoice Creation Service:

- Proper MongoDB schema and REST API for invoice management.
- Cron job for daily sales report generation.
- RabbitMQ producer to publish sales summary reports.

Consumer Service (Email Sending):

- RabbitMQ consumer to process sales summary reports.
- Mock or real implementation for sending emails with the sales report.

General:

- Use Docker or Docker Compose for easy setup and running both services together.
- Ensure proper error handling and logging in both services.
- Testing should cover critical functions and edge cases.
